Hi Cristian / Capstone Team,


As one of the stakeholders in your Cityplayer Walkability project, I’d like to share my thoughts on your final prototype and potential next steps.

 

Congratulations on achieving a robust playable experience which, to a large degree, satisfies the original project goals.

To my mind, the walkability tool serves as a convincing proof-of-concept that this type of gamified interactive approach will be capable of serving the research purposes it was designed for.

 

In order for the tool to be fully deployable for research purposes, 2 of the parameters to be tested (greenery and enclosure) would require further work.

Firstly, the greenery would need to include examples of building-façade greenery such as window flower boxes, hanging baskets, green-facades, and similar, to fully represent the possibilities that greenery can offer.

Secondly, enclosure would need to include a change to building heights as this is an integral part of the enclosure criteria.

The other features such as building diversity, social spaces and block length created an acceptable range of representation; enough for players to give a valid rating.

The high frame rate, well-crafted buildings, and easy controls, give the tool a polished appearance and show its potential to capture different aspects of urban streets.

 

I would like to add a video of this prototype to the suite of prototype videos that represent the different types of citien engagement problem that Cityplayer can solve.

I will also look for additional research funding to develop this tool further as I think you have shown its potential.

 

Thanks so much for taking on the this project.

 

All the best

 

Chris
