Technologies Research

Unity Engine: At the core of our project, Unity provides a robust environment for real-time 3D rendering and interactive experiences. Its
versatile components, such as the Physics engine and Lighting system, as well as the many assets offered will help create immersive street environments.

Blender and Various Unity Asset Websites:
Asset websites such as Unity’s own Asset Store, Sketchfab, and TurboSquid among many others will allow us to utilize specific assets for the purpose of this project for a more dynamic and realistic environment appealing to the user. 
Blender, another useful tool, will allow us to either create 3D assets, or to optimize externally downloaded assets to reduce polygons and improve our software’s performance.
